# taxfix-hack

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Astro, Self, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Astro** - The web framework for content-driven websites
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **SQLite/Turso** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Oxlint** - Oxlint + Oxfmt (linting & formatting)

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses SQLite with Drizzle ORM.

1. Start the local SQLite database (optional):

```bash
bun run db:local
```

2. Update your `.env` file in the `apps/web` directory with the appropriate connection details if needed.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser to see the fullstack application.

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `bun run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

## Deployment

### Docker Compose

- Target: web + server
- Config: `docker-compose.yml` (app Dockerfiles live in `apps/*/Dockerfile`)
- Build images: bun run docker:build
- Start: bun run docker:up
- Logs: bun run docker:logs
- Stop: bun run docker:down

Environment variables are read from each app's `.env` file (baked into web builds for public variables) and overridden in `docker-compose.yml` for container networking.

Docker Compose uses the local `./.data/local.db` file. Run `bun run db:push` before starting the stack.

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying with Docker Compose](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/docker).

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `bun run check`

## Available Scripts

- `bun run dev`: Start all applications in development mode
- `bun run build`: Build all applications
- `bun run dev:web`: Start only the web application
- `bun run check-types`: Check TypeScript types across all apps
- `bun run db:push`: Push schema changes to database
- `bun run db:generate`: Generate database client/types
- `bun run db:migrate`: Run database migrations
- `bun run db:studio`: Open database studio UI
- `bun run db:local`: Start the local SQLite database
- `bun run check`: Run Oxlint and Oxfmt
- `bun run docker:build`: Build the Docker Compose images
- `bun run docker:up`: Build and start the Docker Compose stack
- `bun run docker:logs`: Tail logs from the Docker Compose stack
- `bun run docker:down`: Stop the Docker Compose stack

## Better Auth Schema Generation

After changing auth plugins or schema options, run `bun run auth:generate` from the project root. The script runs the Better Auth CLI through `varlock run` from the owning app directory, loading the auth instance from `src/services.ts`. Review the schema changes, then use your ORM's migration workflow to apply them.
